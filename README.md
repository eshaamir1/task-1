<h1 align="center">Property Listings Application</h1>

<p align="center">
  <strong>A landing page application that displays property listings with data table and card views.</strong>
</p>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>
  This project is built using <strong>React.js</strong> and provides two main views (data table and card view) for displaying property listings. The listings are fetched from a mock API and can be sorted, filtered, searched. The user can switch between the two views, and each listing has a detail page with more information.
</p>

<h2>Requirements and Implementation</h2>

<h3>1. Data Table View</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Implemented a <strong>data table</strong> using React.js components.</li>
  <li>Features include <strong>sorting by price</strong>, filtering, search functionality, and pagination for managing a minimum of 30 property listings.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Card View</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Implemented a <strong>card view</strong> using React.js components, displaying the same set of property listings.</li>
  <li>Users can toggle between <strong>data table</strong> and <strong>card view</strong> using buttons placed at the top of the page.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Detail Page</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Each listing in both views navigates to a <strong>detail page</strong> upon click, displaying additional information such as the image, title, address, beds, bath, covered area in square feet, property type, whether it is commercial or not, and price.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. Mock APIs</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Created <strong>mock APIs</strong> to fetch property listings and detailed information about selected listings based on their ID.</li>
  <li>The <strong>property listings API</strong> returns an array of property objects similar to the provided example.</li>
</ul>
